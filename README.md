## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge was a lot of fun. It was a good practice for flexbox and positioning things. I used color-mix and svg background which was new to me.

### Continued development

I would like to continue improving upon positioning and flexbox.
